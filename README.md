# ASCII Art Discord Bot using Discord.js
😎 This is a simple Discord bot, coded in JavaScript and the Discord.js library. This bot extends the native Discord functionality of commands such as `/tableflip` or `/shrug` with 25+ new emoticons. The bot uses the fairly new Discord feature of Slash Commands.

## Invite the bot
The **ASCII Bot** is hosted 24/7 by the author, and is available for anyone to use freely. You can invite the bot to your server(s) using this link.

## Emoticons
The bot currently contains 25 commands and emoticons, extending Discord's native 3 (`/tableflip`, `/unflip`, and `/shrug`). Here's a full list of the current emoticons the ASCII Bot contains.

1. `finger_guns` : `(☞ﾟヮﾟ)☞`
2. `finger_guns_back` : `☜(ﾟヮﾟ☜)`
3. `unimpressed` : `(¬_¬ )`
4. `crying` : `(╥﹏╥)`
5. `smug` : `(‾⌣‾)`
6. `cool` : `(⌐■_■)`
7. `fight` : `(ง︡'-'︠)ง`
8. `nervous` : `(⊙_⊙;)`
9. `dance` : `(～￣▽￣)～`
10. `praise` : `( ﾉ ﾟｰﾟ)ﾉ`
11. `cute` : `(✿◕‿◕✿)`
12. `sleeping` : `(-.-)Zzz...`
13. `confused` : `(?_?)`
14. `lenny` : `( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)`
15. `lenny_mad` : `( ͠° ͟ʖ ͡°)`
16. `yolo` : `Yᵒᵘ Oᶰˡʸ Lᶤᵛᵉ Oᶰᶜᵉ`
17. `cat` : `=^_^=`
18. `fish` : `` <`)))))< ``
19. `mouse` : `<:3)~~~~`
20. `polar_bear` : `ˁ˚ᴥ˚ˀ`
21. `boombox` : `♫♪.ılılıll|̲̅̅●̲̅̅|̲̅̅=̲̅̅|̲̅̅●̲̅̅|llılılı.♫♪`
22. `santa` : `*<|:‑)`
23. `run` : `` ε=ε=ε=┌(;*´Д`)ﾉ ``
24. `o` : `OwO`
25. `u` : `UwU`

As each Discord bot can have up to 100 Slash Commands, this list probably will get expanded in the future. As a matter of fact, you can help expand this list by suggesting new emoticons using [this form](https://forms.gle/rAcU1UEDZ2pPAht86)!

While all the emoticons are fairly simple, and have probably been created many times by many independent authors, the `resources/sources.txt` file contains the bot's author's sources for all of them.

## Set up & use
If you wish to run the bot yourself, please create a bot application in the Discord Developer Portal (for more instructions, see Tutorial), and then follow these steps:

1. Create a `resources/config.json` file and include your bot token with the key `"token"`.
2. (optional) Edit the `resources/art.json` file to change the bot's emoticon database.
3. Change the information in the `package.json` file to reflect your bot's data.
4. Make sure your bot has the `applications.commands` scope enabled to be able to use Slash Commands.
5. Run the bot via NodeJS by running the `node bot.js` command locally, or set up online hosting.

*The `README.md`, `LICENSE`, `.gitignore`, and `.github` files/folders do not have to be included in the bot's folder. All other files do.*

If you chose to run the bot yourself, please consider sponsoring the project here on GitHub with a few dollars.
